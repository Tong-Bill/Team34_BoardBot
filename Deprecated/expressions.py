Purpose: This file produces the voice over for game setup and provides TTS for social interaction while the game progresses.

Note: gTTS requires internet connection. Alternatives such as pyTTSx3 did not work as intended. Furthermore, features such as Voice recognition and OpenAI(for ChatGPT) did not work with python2.7
